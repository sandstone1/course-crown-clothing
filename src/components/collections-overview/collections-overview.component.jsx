// -- Mark 1 --
// lecture 139: Data Flow In Our App
// we will notice that our " selectStructuredSelector " no longer works and the reason is that
// we've modified SHOP_DATA to be an object and that is affecting the collections array or
// " collections " inside our shop.reducer.js file and whereas " selectCollections " still
// thinks it is an array and to fix this let's create a new selector that can convert our object
// into an array so go shop.reducer.js and create a new selector and now we are back from the
// shop.reducer.js file and let's change
// " import { selectShopCollections } from '../../redux/shop/shop.selectors'; " to
// " import { selectCollectionForPreview } from '../../redux/shop/shop.selectors'; " and let's
// change " collections : selectShopCollections " to " collections : selectCollectionForPreview "
// in mapStateToProps below and now if we go to our app we see that it still works great

// now that we have a solid fundamental understanding of react and redux we will start talking
// more about tradeoffs and how to evaluate what we will build and this will help take us from
// being a beginning react developer to an intermediate or senior react developer

// now let's commit our code

// Rogers-iMac:crown_clothing Home$ git status
// Rogers-iMac:crown_clothing Home$ git add .
// Rogers-iMac:crown_clothing Home$ git commit -m " updated our directory reducer and shop data
// file and then created respective selectors and updated corresponding components "
// Rogers-iMac:crown_clothing Home$ git push origin master

// now if I go to my " crown-clothing " project in GutHub, I see the changes were uploaded
// sucessfully

const mapStateToProps = createStructuredSelector(

    {
        collections : selectCollectionForPreview
    }
