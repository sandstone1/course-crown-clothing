    // here we are setting a property called unsubscribeFromAuth on our class component or

    // to understand what Firebase auth gives us we have to understand the concept of subscription

    // method but doing it this way is only good for a one off situation but we don't want to
    // remount our app, we just always want to know when the authentication state of a user has
    // changed so we want to know whenever a user signs in or signs out so let's use " auth " or
    // the auth library and call the onAuthStateChanged method on auth and we will do this inside
    // the componentDidMount method
    componentDidMount() {
        // inside onAuthStateChanged we will call a function and the argument will be a " user "
        // and we will update state based on the user argument, which is an object

        // " this.unsubscribeFromAuth " will equal a function and when we call this function we
        // will close the subscription that we created below and we close the subscription
        // in componentWillUnmount below

        // lecture 91: Storing User Data In Our App
        // so below we are calling the " createUserProfileDocument() " function that we just
        // made
        
        // remember, in the last video we stored the user data in our database but now
        // we have to store that data in the " state " of our application so we can use it
        // in our app

        // let's modify our code so we understand what is actually happening

        // first let's change
        // " this.unsubscribeFromAuth = auth.onAuthStateChanged( async ( user ) => { " to
        // " this.unsubscribeFromAuth = auth.onAuthStateChanged( async ( userAuth ) => { "
        // because now we know what were getting back is a userAuth

        // remember we first need to comment out " createUserProfileDocument( user ); " and
        // " console.log( user ); " below

        this.unsubscribeFromAuth = auth.onAuthStateChanged( async ( userAuth ) => {

            // what we are saying below is that if the userAuth object is not null or meaning it
            // does exist then we want to run the code inside the if statement below and
            // if the user is signed out then userAuth will be " null " or false so the if
            // statement below will not run in this situation and this is what we want because
            // we don't want to setState if the user has signed out
            if ( userAuth ) {

                // remember, what we get back from our createUserProfileDocument() function is
                // the userRef and remember if the firebase.utils.js file we returned userRef
                // or did " return userRef; " at the bottom of the
                // createUserProfileDocument() function and so it makes sense when we call the
                // createUserProfileDocument() function in App.js we will get back the userRef
                // object
                const userRef = await createUserProfileDocument( userAuth );

                // and we want the userRef object because we are going to check and see if our
                // database has updated at that reference location with any new data so were
                // kind of saying has the snapShot changed?

                // the moment the following code runs or the moment this code runs:
                // " userRef.onSnapShot() " we will get back is a snapshot object and this object
                // will represent the data that is currently stored in our database so this
                // code will give us a snapShot object and on this snapShot object we will be able
                // to get the data related to the user that we may have just created and stored
                // in our database ( i.e. we did this in the last lecture ) or the data related
                // to the user that is already stored in our Firestrore database

                // now let's talk about the snapShot object and Yihua is now reading from a
                // slide that is titled " DocumentSnapshot "

                // from slide bullet #1 - " we get a documentSnapshot object from our
                // documentReference object " and we do this by using the .get() method

                // from slide bullet #2 - " the documentSnapshot object allows us to check
                // if a document exists at this query using the .exists property which
                // returns a boolean "

                // from slide bullet #3 - the documentSnapshot object also allows us to " get
                // the actual properties on the object by calling the .data() method, which returns
                // a JSON object of the document " or this method will return a JSON object of
                // the document

                // and remember, we do not get any data until we use the data method on snapShot
                // and if we do " snapShot.data() " as shown below then we will get the following

            // in the console even though it does not exist in the database?
            // the reason for this is because we use this reference object or DocumentReference object
            // to tell Firestore whether to save data to this place in our database or to get data
            // from this location in the database

            // however, remember the queryReference object does not have the actual data
            // of the collection or document but instead it gives us properties that tell details
            // about it like the ID or the path of this specific query reference and we saw this
            // happen above in the " DocumentReference "

            // but what we are also able to see in this DocumentReference is that the parent is a
            // CollectionReference representing the collection that this document is in and here
            // we'll see we have " id : " users "" " and " path : " users " "

            // the difference between the DocumentReference and the CollectionReference is that we
            // will use the DocumentReference object to preform CRUD operations in our Firestore
            // database and CRUD stands for creating, retrieving, updating and deleting data in
            // a specific location in our Firestore database

            // so we use documentRef objects to preform our CRUD methods and the CRUD
            // methods are .set(), .get(), .update() and delete(), respectively

            // when we retrieve the data we are calling .get() and .get() is us pulling out
            // a snapshot object of that place in the database and the snapshot object was the
            // second type of object we discussed earlier in the firebase.utils.js file and this
            // is the second type of object that Firestore can give us back and we will be able
            // to use this snapshot object in order to determine whether or not there is any data
            // in the current reference in our Firestore database

            // again, remember the snapshot object is something we get back from calling .get()
            // or per Yihua's lecture slide " we get the snapshotObject from the referenceObject
            //  using the .get() method ( i.e. documentRef.get() or collectionRef.get() ) " and
            // collectionRef.get() gives us back a snapshot of the collection or
            // collectionRef returns a querySnapshot object and documentRef returns a
            // documentSnapshot object 

            // remember, we can also add documents to collections using the collectionRef
            // object and using the .add() method or collectionRef.add();

            // collectionRef.get(); gives us back a snapshot of the collection and we
            // won't use this much in this course but it is good know it exists and from

            // URL in a new window our user object will still persist and in the case below

            // feature of Firebase because we are able to get persistence of our user session
            // without having to do any seperate set up

            // let's take another look at the user object in the console and the main keys we
            // want to look at are the " displayName " and " email " and Firebase gives us OAuth
            // right out of the gate and OAuth allows users to sign in with any third party
            // service that they might already have and by doing this we have reduced the
            // barrier of entry for allowing users to sign into our application since users
            // don't need to go through an arduous sign up process or remember their email
            // and password in order to sign into our app and OAuth is a very difficult and
            // tedious thing to set up from scratch but with Firebase we get access to OAuth
            // with just a couple configuration settings and this is why Firebase is such an
            // incredible platform

            // now, the next thing we have to do is understand why this is an open subscription
            // so the function we are currently in " auth.onAuthStateChanged( ( user ) => { } "
            // is an open messaging system between our application and Firebase and this means
            // that whenever any changes occur on Firebase from any source and those changes are
            // related to this application then Firebase will send out a message that the auth
            // state has changed and this auth state change could be the user signing in or the
            // user signing out and this connection is always open as long as our application
            // component is mounted on our DOM and remember that since this is an open
            // subscription we also need to close the subscription when the application component
            // unmounts in order to prevent memory leaks and to do that go to
            // " unsubscribeFromAuth = null " above and then go to componentWillUnmount below

            // after lecture 91, I changed " console.log( user ); " to " console.log( userAuth ); "
            // so that I could see the userAuth object in the console
            console.log( userAuth );
        }
        );

    }

    // this method will allow us to unsubscribe from OAuth when the application component
    // unmounts
    componentWillUnmount() {
        // and we ubsubscribe from the subscription or close the subscription by calling
        // this.unsubscribeFromAuth()
        this.unsubscribeFromAuth();
    }

    // in summary, the above is how we make our application aware of any auth changes on

// -- Mark 13 -- continued
// lecture 105: User Redirect and User Action Type
// we are going to need the currentUser from redux so we need to use mapStateToProps below in
// order to get the currentUser value and
// we are going to destructure our " user " off of " state " and remember " user " equals
// " user : userReducer " or the userReducer inside the root-reducer.js file so instead of
// writing ( state.user ) we will write ( { user } ) and we have to write it this way because
// we can't write ( state.user ) since this results in an error

// change " connect( null, mapDispatchToProps ) " to
// " connect( mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps ) " below

// now we have access to this.props.currentUser and now go the routes above
const mapStateToProps = ( { user } ) => (
    {
        currentUser : user.currentUser
    }
);



// -- Mark 12 -- continued
// lecture 104: mapDispatchToProps
// were going to connect our App component to the outcome of our first connect call using
// null as the first argument since we don't need mapStateToProps in App.js but we do need
// the second argumnent, which is mapDispatchToProps and let's create the mapDispatchToProps
// function below

// the mapDispatchToProps functions takes the dispatch property as an argument and then we will
// return an object and let's import in setCurrentUser above and in our object below we will set 
// our property equal to setCurrentUser and setCurrentUser will be equal to a function that takes
// the user object as an argument and then calls the dispatch function and the argument to our
// dispatch function is our setCurrentUser action object and we will pass that action object
// to every reducer

// now we can eliminate our state object above or " state = { currentUser : null }; " and then
// we will replace our setState code or 

/*
this.setState(
    {
        currentUser : {
            id : snapShot.id,
            ...snapShot.data()
        }
    }
);
*/

// with our setCurrentUser action code so replace the above this.setState() code with

/*
this.props.setCurrentUser(
    {
        id : snapShot.id,
        ...snapShot.data()
    }
);
*/

// so we are still passing in our snapShot object but now we are setting the currentUser
// value equal to the above object
const mapDispatchToProps = ( dispatch ) => ( 
    {
        setCurrentUser : ( user ) => dispatch( setCurrentUser( user ) )
    } 
);



export default connect( mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps )( App );
